                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm a brazilian full-stack student, i started my journey in the IT area at 10 years old when I took a robotics course. It was during this course that I discovered my passion for programming.</p>
                <p>At 14, I took a game development course, which deepened my interest in coding. However, what I truly enjoyed learning were technologies like HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>At 15, I joined a technical electronics course, where I gained more experience with technology. During this time, I found myself truly enjoying technologies like HTML, CSS, Java, Python, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I graduated from the technical electronics course at 17, and since then, I've been focused on enhancing my programming and development skills.</p>
